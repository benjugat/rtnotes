Here are a few tricks that I have discovered over my malware development journey:

* Encrypt and change permissions of your payload and modules if there are not in use.
* EDRs scans RWX memory pages, try to RW->RX.
* Use the APIs closest to kernel, produce less telemetry.
* Obfuscate all the calls.
* Duplicate handles instead of create new ones.
* Inject from noisy contexts like SYSTEM or csrss.exe.
* **The idea of evasion consists of being invisible by being common.**
